In addition applying this file, as of dev10 modules that use Compose also need to include this
code snippet to avoid warnings about using compiler version 1.4 (this is because the compiler plugin
is built against compiler source that is in a liminal state between 1.3 and 1.4, the warnings are
safe to ignore and this suppresses them):

tasks.withType<KotlinCompile>().configureEach {
 kotlinOptions.apiVersion = "1.3"
}
*/

android {
  buildFeatures {
    compose true
  }
  composeOptions {
    kotlinCompilerVersion "1.4.0-dev-withExperimentalGoogleExtensions-20200720"
    kotlinCompilerExtensionVersion Versions.compose
  }
}
